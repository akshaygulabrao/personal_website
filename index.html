    website that i use to talk about what happens in my life, which ironically takes up a majority of it
    <article>today i decided to start this website and that is where the majority of my time went today the date is 2nov21<br>
      <section>The tag indicates a major part of page: usually a heading tag followed 
        by some text. How do you know whether a chunk of the page is “major” or not? 
        The <span style="font-variant: small-caps;color:red">easiest way</span> is to imagine if your page had a table of contents. If you’d want a 
        particular part of your page to be included in that table of contents, then it’s major 
        enough to merit the tag.</section>
