    <h1>About Me</h1>
    I am finishing my Masters in Computer Science from the University of California Riverside. I am looking for a career in Machine Learning.
    <h1>Work Experience</h1>
      <h2>Student Researcher</h2>
        <h3>University of California-Riverside</h3>
          <h4>June 2021 - September 2021</h4>
            Worked with MPQUIC, a multipath user layer protocol and tried to add support for stochastic gradient descent congestion control protocol PCC Vivace. I also created scripts to help visualize congestion window behavior for varying path characteristics using mininet network emulation.
      <h2>Software Developer Intern</h2>
        <h3>Cognitus Consulting</h3>
          <h4>June 2020 - September 2020</h4>
          Worked with UiPath Automation which takes input a skill keyword and outputs an Excel sheet a list of people on LinkedIn that match the keyword. Worked with Microsoft Bot Framework that allows users to enter multiple pieces of information in 1 turn (not natively supported).
